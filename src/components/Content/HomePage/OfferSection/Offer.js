          â€œA spiral and colourful earth wall surrounds a secret orchard, leading
          to a centralwater and energy collector. Source is a contemporary
          desert hortus conclusus where low-tech knowledge mixes with modern
          technology and ancients art.<br></br>
          <br></br> The fourteenth-century strategy of fruits walls emerged long
          before the invention of the energy-consuming glasshouses of the
          nineteenth century. By planting trees within ptotective masonery walls
          with high thermal mass capabilities, the stored heat of the sun is
          released through the night.
